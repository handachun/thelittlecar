          Hello, it's been a long time, it's really been too long.<br>
          Yet, it didn't feel that long for me.<br>
          You see, I was thinking and thinking, and running<br>
          that million mile march, and it kept me going.<br>
          There, I was, and there, you were with me.<br>
          Yeah, I guess I get trapped in my mind, and I hole up<br>
          in its little cave, but I promise,<br>
          it's a lot bigger on the inside!<br><br>
          
          Good morning, the sun's rising, and my heart is strong.<br>
          Ah, It sings in me in a major key.<br>
          Hmmm, you see, I like it when the morning air fills my lungs and it
          rings<br>
          a sound of a thousand brilliant bells, flowing. <br>
          Do you hear it too? Maybe it's just me,<br>
          but I'm sure I'm not mistaken-- join me with your little pup!<br>
          There, wake up with me, and you will see, you can't miss<br>
          the morning sun with me outside.<br><br>

          Good day, the blue sky kisses with no wrong.<br>
          The day, indeed, feels so short, though we must now be forty!<br>
          Yes, it has been a couple years, but with you, time is speeding,<br>
          holding me captive, though I certainly have been rowing <br>
          in the opposite direction. That's just me!<br>
          O foolish me! Haha, wanting to defeat time herself, saying,
          "Holdup!"<br>
          You can call me dumb, romantic, or this<br>
          weird looking thing I hold in my center body inside.<br><br>

          Good evening, the sky is painted redder than a swan songi.<br>
          O, darling do you hear it? That passionate plea!<br>
          It creeps upon, and it rips up that stowing<br>
          care and gentleness, it takes your breath from me.<br>
          I can't breathe-- can you? Up... Up. Up! Up!!!<br>
          Get up, you look still as young as twenty, come give me a kiss.<br>
          Oh, won't you get up? We must, you see, go outside.<br>

          Good bye, the eyes close and so my sky blackens. So long<br>
          this darkness, O she tortures me.<br>
          She laughs, and can't stop thinking, and I stop running<br>
          this million mile march, without you, I can't keep going.<br>
          Here, I am, and here, I am with me.<br>
          Yeah, I'm a terrible companion; trapped, I hole up<br>
          in this little cave, and I promise,<br>
          it's gotten bigger since you've been outside.<br>
