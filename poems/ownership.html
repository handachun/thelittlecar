          <p>
          there's a lot of talk about ownership.<br>
          you should own up to what you did.<br>
          you should own up to who you are.<br>
          <br>
          but what do you do if you don't own anything?<br>
          what do you do if you own nothing<br>
          or rather, if nothing owns you?<br>
          <br>
          it's not like you don't want to belong.<br>
          or to have something to belong to you.<br>
          but what if nothing is at home with you?<br>
          <br>
          frustrating- it really is.<br>
          when no one seems to care or to see.<br>
          that you're trying but it's not working.<br>
          <br>
          and when you've not ownership and are ownerless,<br>
          you tend to be as light as a feather.<br>
          and that's a problem because you start to float<br>
          <br>
          you float in that space of mind and thought,<br>
          where you don't know who you are,<br>
          and you certainly don't know where the ground is<br>
          <br>
          you hear people shouting for you to come down.<br>
          but where is the ground really? i don't know.<br>
          you're not even sure what that is.<br>
          <br>
          it's not as though you're not frightened.<br>
          you're as depressed as you could be though you float on.<br>
          being high in the mind doesn't really equate to a high.<br>
          <br>
          so you live on and realize there's nothing you can do.<br>
          and you smile a little and laugh a lot.<br>
          and everyone says, he's doing fine.<br>
          <br>
          no one really cares and it really shows.<br>
          the one that said, i care and i like you, didn't mean it.<br>
          just needed someone to mess with for the summer.<br>
          <br>
          so what can you really do?<br>
          you hover the line between living and dying, gasping.<br>
          and when you smell the flowers, realize they aren't flowers.<br>
          <br>
          drift on as you float on, no ownership.<br>
          you become untethered, ownerless.<br>
          spiral out of control and write a thing.<br>
