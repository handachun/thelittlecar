        <h1 class="poem-title"> The Handa </h1>
        <div class="poem">
          <p>
          They say the Handa roams the streets, but I ain’t got no proof,<br>
          They say that if your house got walls, he’s probably on your roof!<br>
          Rumor is he hates dem’ jokes or anything that's funny<br>
          And if ya laugh, and laugh sum’ more, he’ll roar a big “blas’ phummy”!<br>
          We tried to trick em’ with a trap, we tried it every week,<br>
          We tied up hooks to piles of books, we even made em’ greek,<br>
          I hummed dem’ hymns he always sung, I said I was reformin’,<br>
          He almost came that other day, but then he saw a mormon.<br>
          Dem persecutors come around, tryna throw him into court,<br>
          But never seem to hunt him down, they say he's just too short!<br>
          I went far n’ wide to look for clues, found myself in Uganda<br>
          To find the man that they called Roy, to help me hunt the Handa<br><br>
          We looked real hard to find this Roy, took every nerve n’ fiber,<br>
          And when we did he turned us down, said I wasn’t a subscriber,<br>
          Told Roy I only got one thing, but he didn’t let me ask it,<br>
          He took a ball and went away, to shoot it in some basket,<br>
          But we refused to give up quick, we asked till it got dark,<br>
          And if ya saw how much we asked, you’d call us Allen Park!<br>
          We got the Roy to give us facts, to learn about the Handa,<br>
          He sometimes likes to speak in code, in python anaconda,<br>
          When it comes to Christian men, he tends to be dutch-lovin,<br>
          And if you wanna cook him bread, he only eats dutch oven,<br>
          He runs like crazy here and there, they say it's called parkour,<br>
          And when the wind blows at his face, his hair will just part more!<br><br>
          Roy took a funny lookin’ bullet, and put it on the gun,<br>
          He said there was no other way, to catch this Handa Chun,<br>
          It ain’t no help tryna pin him down, cause’ he never lost a fight,<br>
          But if ya shoot him with this bullet, then he’ll never cease to write!<br>
          You got a chance to catch him there, he’ll prolly’ write for ages,<br>
          And if you saw his “short response”, you’d see its sixty pages!<br>
          So we got a place and made a trap, we tried to lure him here,<br>
          We put a sign up on our door, we called it Ligonier,<br>
          And not too long we saw him come, we gave him Bible things<br>
          I aimed my gun as he was readin’, I shot him at 1 Kings,<br>
          I waited for him to get his pen, to write bout’ Ahab and Naboth,<br>
          But this bullet didn’t do a thing, he said he don’t work on Sabbath!<br><br>
          We thot’ he’d get real loud and mad, like crazy John the Baptist,<br>
          Was scared that he would eat me up, become a Handa breakfast,<br>
          But he didn’t throw his one inch punch, nor let out a big loud roar,<br>
          He laughed and said there was time, that he was caught before,<br>
          He said this Man was powerful, had nails stuck in His wrist,<br>
          This Man could break down any chain, with grace ya can’t resist,<br>
          He said this Man gave him a drink, some special living water,<br>
          This Man who could just hunt him down, became a given slaughter,<br>
          Said His blood defeated death, he called this Man preeminent,<br>
          Told me to find a gift called faith, to be part of His free remnant,<br>
          Then he escaped our trap and left, was once again on the run,<br>
          And left me thinking bout’ this Man, who once caught Handa Chun.<br><br><br>
